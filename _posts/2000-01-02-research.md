As a member of the German Center for Infection Research bioinformatics platform, it is my task to bridge the gap between established bioinformatics and the medical data from clinical research. I am mainly involved in meta'omics projects.

Additionally, our team organizes regular <a href="http://www.bioinformatics-platform.dzif.de/?page_id=50" target="_blank">bioinformatics training workshops</a>, covering a broad range of topics from pipeline programming and Linux basics to metagenome analysis and variant calling. If you are interested, please get in touch!

Supported by a fellowship of the *CLIB Graduate Cluster Industrial Biotechnology*, I developed new tools and algorithms that naturally exploit the complementary nature of single cells and metagenomes. We collaborated with <a href="http://jgi.doe.gov/about-us/organization/prokaryote-super-program/tanja-woyke/" target="_blank">Tanja Woyke's group</a> at the DOE Joint Genome Institute to improve the quality of single cell genome assemblies.

In a second big project, we sampled multiple production-scale biogas plants in Germany and sequenced their metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. Combined, these data will enable a deeper exploration of the biogas-producing microbial community, with the objective to develop rational strategies for process optimization.
